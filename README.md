# 2019-Gaspe-WaterIsotopes.csv contains a file of water samples collected from 12 streams in September 2019 from the Gaspe Region, as part of the Spruce Budworm Hg project. The samples were sent to the Vezier Lab (Ottawa) for Stable Isotope analysis of Hydrogen and Oxygen. 
# For this dataset, I would like to explore any patterns in the isotope signatures in the water. I would like to explore whether there are differences between my 2 treatments (defoliated vs spray sites) or between the different locations (upper, central, and lower). For this exploratory data analysis, I will use a complication of graphing (boxplots, bar graphs, etc) and statistics (ie. T-tests)
